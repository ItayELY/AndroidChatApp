# AndroidChatApp
This a the android version of our chatUp this application
By the way, we are happy to have received to our new member to our team, Elad Vizenblit.
(Please note that Yotam has clearly allowed us not to implement the Horizonatl Layout feature.)


How to run our application?
First, run our API server which you can find at:
https://github.com/ItayELY/ChatAppApi3/tree/androidAPI
note that you must change the password (currently itaymariadb) to your mariaDB root user password.

Then, run the Android application which you can find in the "master" branch of this repository. (https://github.com/ItayELY/AndroidChatApp)

Running the Android application, you will see a login page. You can log in to an existing accound, or switch the register page, and register as a new user.
You can also visit out "setting" page in order to change varous settings of the app.
